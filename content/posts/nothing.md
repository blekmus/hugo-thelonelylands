I have found nothing\
No potent spasm of truth’s hue\
No certainty in depths of visible divinity

I have no enlightenment\
No scar laid barely on slopes of thought\
No ignition electrifying the libraries of cognition

I have discovered no principle\
No strings of rules hardened in stone\
No temple where reason stands helpful

I have no letter\
No filament of Hermes to guide my path\
No key deciphering the chains of reality

I have discovered no Magnum Opus\
No visiting visage vanishing vastly\
No tranquility in my mind’s nihility
