Since time was tender\
before man became the ruler\
Came the carrier of existence\
From grain to dew\
Brown to blue

The womb of life\
Evolved till perfection\
the wonder of all who yonder\
Admired by all who ponder

The harmonic roar of the ocean\
the bright azure of the frozen\
The arctic breeze of the eve\
Yet! Too exquisite to comprehend

The mother of all\
Deliberately disrupted by man\
From delicate and scenic\
To artificial to man-made\
In sequential cycle\
Leaving only grief to enjoy!
