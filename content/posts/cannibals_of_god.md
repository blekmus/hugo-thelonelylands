Catholicism is fabricated mainly around the sacred sacrifice of Christ. The O'holy saviour. The religion and it's doctrine, though evolved through the ages- by newer creeds and other updates- still follow the initial cause. The worship of the all mighty triad, the holy trinity. As a custom to the last supper, implemented by Jesus. And to this day, in remembrance of the supper held two millennia ago. Worshipers spiritually perform a weekly ritual, called the holy mass. As stated in the Bible attendance to this get together is a must for followers. Whom also believe that the living Christ is present in the blessed bread, devoured at the climax of every mass and that it nourishes and heals them. Meaning, they eat the living Christ in order to be blessed, healed. Thereby making Catholics cannibals of their own god.
