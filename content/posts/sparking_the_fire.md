The system deceased\
The people deserted\
to survive is to conquer\
The tribute of trust\
Love and honour

The horizon stretching till eternity\
The wonders fading by day and night\
To ponder the untouchable grace\
shining.....far. Yet!\
Touched only by thy fruitful dream.

The sacred crimson flows, still\
Through the break and strike of day.\
Tis the agony faced so forth\
Till the bewildered go wild

The affluent beware, the riches foreseen\
The fire glows revenge\
Fueled by pain and anger\
By insult and shadow\
Through existence and demise.
