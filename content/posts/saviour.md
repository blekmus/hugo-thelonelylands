You show me the way, but believe would I not.\
You say you care for me, but for that, I say not.\
You say you hold me, but when in need you be there not.\
You say you trust me, but in it, I trust you not.\
You say you look upon us, but I see you not.\
You say you sacrifice for us, but it affects us not.

Truth is what you say you give, but truth indeed is what you dearly nought.\
Hope you say is what you bring, but greed is what you simply brought.\
Forever is what you say you want, but the end is what I truly sought.\
Sorrow you say is what I really am, but the truth is what I sincerely taught.
