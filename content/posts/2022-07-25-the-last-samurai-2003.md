I don't watch western movies often. My entire entertainment diet these days is taken up by Japanese media. More specifically anime. This has been the case since I started my journey into anime back in late 2020. Ever since I got a taste. I haven't been able to stop. As if the whole medium was made for me. I feel right at home with the stories being told. Compared to just a couple of years ago. You could say, I've entirely stopped watching western content. I don't enjoy most media made by western studios anymore. I used to watch them with curious eyes. Now, my eyes only focus on the time.

The last few western movies I watched were filled with utter dissapointment. Even movies by studios like Marvel. Which I adored up until Avengers Endgame feels stale now. Dr Strange Into the Multiverse felt like a bunch of characters who could do spectacular things a minute ago but can't when the enemy is right in front of them. Thor Love and Thunder is basically a joke, literally. Jurassic World Dominiation is simply utter crap. Its logic is so bad I had trouble even figuring out how the writers were able to justify a plot that awful

The last movies i watched were, Thor love and thunder. Jurassic world Domination and Dr. Strange into the multiverse. Through all of them. I felt drained. The movies didn't have a soul to them. It only felt like they were vessel for either political discourse or stupid jokes. They didn't feel grounded. I'm not saying movie should be inherently grounded like Monster. But it should at least have a certain level of logic or limitations to the plot. If not, how would I connect with the characters. If they end up great no matter what they do. Where are the steaks? How am I supposed to care about their fates? If plot armour is all they have, what makes them think I'd go out of my way to care about them.\

Most modern movies are built upon their blockbusterness. They're visually marvelous. There hasn't been any movies before that looked as good as the one's that are out now. But that's about all that can be said about them. They're empty but beautiful husks.\

Then there are movies like, the last samurai, 12 angry men or the two popes. Those titles inspired me. Their characters made me emotional. They didn't feel empty. There's a huge difference between these movies and those blockbusters.
