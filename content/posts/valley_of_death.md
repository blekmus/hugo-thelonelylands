One walks in the swale\
Of fluorescent dark\
Amidst Adversities\
Of peculiar burden and amenity\
Voyaging the valley of death.

In reflection of oneself\
Glaring deathly through one's eyes\
Past clouds of bluffs and masks\
To the bare frost within.

As i walk through the valley of death. I complete my last dance.
